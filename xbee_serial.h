 *
 * Description: This is an example of how to do semi-asynchronous serial
 *              programming under linux.
 *              This was tested on a Dell Inspiron running Ubuntu 12.10.
 *              The program receives user input and processes it to make it an
 *              XBee compatible command to output to the serial port.
 *              The response from the XBee to each command it understands is
 *              then printed on the console. 
 *
 *              So this program can be executed as a basic terminal emulator.
 *              So, this is basically a serial asynchronous chat program with
 *              XBee module.
 *
 *              For demonstration purposes, the program accepts and
 *              responds to 1 command:
 *
 *              "exit" --- Response: Prints:
 *                         Exiting as ordered! Goodbye!.
 *                         Then it exits/shuts down.
 *
 *              If you type: "+++<ENTER>", from the keyboard the XBee should
 *              respond with: "OK<CR>".
 *
 *              If you type anything else followed by <ENTER>, from the
 *              the program sends out that stuff you typed followed by <CR>.
 *              The XBee will respond with appropriate response followed by 
 *              "<CR>". i.e. if it understands the command you just sent.
